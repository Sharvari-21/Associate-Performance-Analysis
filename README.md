## ðŸ§  Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance data of business development associates using Python and Power BI, and derive actionable insights. This includes identifying patterns in lead generation, measuring consistency, and understanding the impact of team review meetings, with the intent to assist HR and leadership in performance evaluation and forecasting.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

### Python (via Google Colab):

* `pandas` â€“ for data manipulation
* `numpy` â€“ for numerical analysis
* `matplotlib` / `seaborn` â€“ for plotting
* `sklearn` â€“ for regression modeling and evaluation

### Power BI:

Used to design a clean and static dashboard with five key visualizations:

* Performance Trend vs Team Review Attendance
* Time vs Leads Heatmap
* Monthly Performance Comparison
* Daily Incomplete Leads Trend
* Time Distribution Box Plot (per associate)

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis Highlights

* **Most Consistent Performer:** Arya (lowest coefficient of variation in daily leads)
* **Optimal Lead Generation Time:** Between **200â€“250 mins/day** showed peak lead productivity
* **Impact of Team Reviews:** Associates performed significantly better on days they attended team review meetings
* **Prediction Models:** Built linear regression models per associate to forecast future lead generation
* **Tentative Projections:** Slight decline trend observed, suggesting focus areas for improvement

## âœ… Recommendations

* Encourage daily team review attendance to maintain consistent productivity
* Guide associates with high time variance to standardize daily LG efforts
* Focus on reducing incomplete leads, especially for high-output individuals like Ali
* Continue monitoring monthly patterns to prepare for seasonal dips

## ðŸ”® Future Scope

* Incorporate qualitative feedback or performance ratings to enrich analysis
* Automate dashboard refresh with real-time data
* Introduce classification or clustering models for performance segmentation
